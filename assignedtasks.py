Task 1
1. Set up your own independent GitHub repository for your project. Get all current code moved in and working.
   Send evidence of completion of this task to Lin via email.
2. Demonstrate that you know how to use simpy to simulate behavior of five trucks trying to pass through an intersection
   from four different directions. Send evidence of completion of this task to Lin via email.
3. Build the model of your city map in Python, using classes for highway, road, and two types of intersections. Create
   instantiated objects for each of the items in your city map.
4. Implement "something simple" on top of the model to show that the implementation works in some basic sense.

Task2
1. Design and implement classes for "truck" and subclasses of different kinds of trucks that your company owns.
   You get to decide the subtypes of trucks, you get to decide the attributes of the various classes.
2. Instantiate a bunch of trucks that your company owns.
3. One of the methods for "truck" should allow you to queue up a truck for entry onto a road or highway at an end point.
   You will need to think about how to use simpy to do this!  You seem to have a good handle in simpy already, so this
   shouldn't be too hard.
4. Another method for "truck" should be something that moves it along a road and/or highway.  You'll have to decide how
   you're going to design, organize, and implement this moving-along-ness.  You should use simpy to model what happens
   at intersections.
